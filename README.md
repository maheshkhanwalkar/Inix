# inix

The Inix kernel is an experimental Unix-like operating system. See the docs/ directory for detailed
documentation on the various subsystems, build instructions, and generating bootable disk images.

Development of new features, architectures, and drivers occurs in separate branches. Once the changes have
been tested and validated for the most part, they are then merged into mainline. Check the [branches](https://github.com/maheshkhanwalkar/inix/branches)
for specific details.
